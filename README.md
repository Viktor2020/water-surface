Description
===========

A basic OpenGL implementation of GPU Gems Chapter 1: "Effective Water Simulation from Physical Models", which can be found [here](http://developer.nvidia.com/node/110). This implementation is very simple and it could benefit from more parameter tweaking and artistic input. It would be more visually satisfying if used with an environment map combined with fresnel. The current fresnel combination is based on hardcoded colors.
